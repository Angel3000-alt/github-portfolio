# Lab Network Traffic Analysis & Protocol Auditing  
 November, 2025  
 Completed  

## 🎯 Objective
To design and configure a small office network using Cisco Packet Tracer by implementing router-based connectivity, assigning IP addressing, and validating end-to-end internet access for multiple internal devices.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* Cisco Packet Tracer v8.x – Network simulation and device configuration  
* Cisco IOS (Router CLI) – Routing and interface configuration  
* IPv4 Addressing & Subnetting  
* Ethernet Switching  

## 🔍 Key Findings
1. **Router Configuration:**  
   Successfully configured router interfaces using static IP addressing and enabled inter-network communication between internal office devices and the external network.

2. **Network Segmentation:**  
   Connected multiple endpoint devices (PCs, laptops, printers) through switches, ensuring proper Layer 2 forwarding and Layer 3 routing.

3. **Internet Connectivity Validation:**  
   Verified internet access via ICMP echo requests, confirming correct gateway configuration and routing.

4. **Configuration Accuracy:**  
   Demonstrated that improper IP addressing or missing default gateway settings immediately disrupt connectivity, reinforcing the importance of precise network configuration.

## 🧠 Technical Analysis
 * Router interfaces were configured and brought online using Cisco IOS commands.
* End devices received static IP addresses within the same subnet.
* Default gateway settings enabled traffic to exit the local network.
* Packet flow simulation confirmed successful data transmission across the network.

## 💡 Lessons Learned
This lab reinforced foundational enterprise networking concepts, including:
* Router-based traffic forwarding
* IP addressing and subnet consistency
* Gateway dependency for external communication
* The role of accurate configuration in maintaining availability  

In a real office environment, these skills directly support network deployment, troubleshooting, and access reliability.
